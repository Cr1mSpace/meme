To create a memecoin on the Solana blockchain that burns 3% of tokens during each transaction, we need to modify the standard SPL token transfer logic to include a burn mechanism. The burn function will deduct 3% of the tokens from the transfer amount and destroy them by sending them to a null account.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement such a token in Rust using Solana's Anchor framework.

Steps to Implement the Memecoin with a 3% Burn Feature
Set up your development environment:

Install the required tools: Solana CLI, Rust, and Anchor.
Initialize the project: Create a new Anchor project by running:

bash
Copy code
anchor init memecoin_with_burn
cd memecoin_with_burn
Modify the smart contract (lib.rs):

Update the lib.rs file inside programs/memecoin_with_burn/src/ to handle the transfer with burn functionality.

Here's the code:

rust
Copy code
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Mint, TokenAccount, Token, Transfer, Burn};

declare_id!("YourProgramID");

#[program]
pub mod memecoin_with_burn {
    use super::*;

    // Function to transfer tokens and burn 3%
    pub fn transfer_with_burn(ctx: Context<TransferWithBurn>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        // Calculate the 3% burn amount
        let burn_amount = (amount as u128 * 3) / 100; // 3% of the transferred amount
        let transfer_amount = amount - burn_amount as u64; // Remaining amount after burn

        // Burn the 3%
        let burn_ctx = CpiContext::new(
            ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
            Burn {
                mint: ctx.accounts.mint.to_account_info(),
                from: ctx.accounts.from.to_account_info(),
                authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
            },
        );
        token::burn(burn_ctx, burn_amount as u64)?;

        // Transfer the remaining amount to the recipient
        let transfer_ctx = CpiContext::new(
            ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
            Transfer {
                from: ctx.accounts.from.to_account_info(),
                to: ctx.accounts.to.to_account_info(),
                authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
            },
        );
        token::transfer(transfer_ctx, transfer_amount)?;

        Ok(())
    }
}

// Context for the transfer and burn operation
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct TransferWithBurn<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub from: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,  // Sender's token account
    #[account(mut)]
    pub to: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,    // Recipient's token account
    #[account(mut)]
    pub mint: Account<'info, Mint>,          // The mint (token) being used
    #[account(signer)]
    pub authority: AccountInfo<'info>,       // Authority of the sender
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>, // SPL token program
}
Explanation:
transfer_with_burn function: This function takes in the amount to transfer, calculates the 3% burn, then burns those tokens by invoking the Burn instruction of the SPL token program. After burning the 3%, it transfers the remaining 97% to the recipient.
CpiContext::new: This creates a context for both the burn and transfer instructions, which specify the accounts involved (e.g., sender, recipient, mint, and the authority).
burn function: This is used to destroy tokens by sending them to a null account, reducing the total supply of tokens in circulation.
4. Compile the program:
Run the following command to compile the smart contract:

bash
Copy code
anchor build
5. Deploy the program to Solana:
Once the program is compiled, you can deploy it to the Solana devnet or mainnet using the following command:

bash
Copy code
solana program deploy target/deploy/memecoin_with_burn.so
6. Create and mint tokens:
After deploying the contract, you can use the Solana CLI to create and mint your memecoin using the SPL token CLI.

To create a token:

bash
Copy code
spl-token create-token
To create an associated token account for holding the tokens:

bash
Copy code
spl-token create-account <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
To mint tokens to that account:

bash
Copy code
spl-token mint <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT>
Now you have a memecoin on Solana with an automatic 3% burn during each transaction!
